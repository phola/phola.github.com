Wow 15 years...It's been a fun ride since I upped sticks in 1998 to jump in the deep-end as a freelance developer. I've been lucky enough to work on many varied projects and meet some great people along the way. Huge thanks to all the clients and colleguaues especially my wife and partner Veronique.

We've taken the opportunity to have a break and introduce our finest acheivent, first-born Jonathan to his extended family around the globe (and get some  beach time;).  geek, exciting time to develop. back in the new year....2013.

Part of this resulted in the creation of this nice new simple clean all shiny  responsive markdown and githubbed site. Hopefully it'll encourage me to do a bit more posting. There wasn't much worth saving from the old site so - fresh start for 2013...hope you have a fun one.


Good winds
Geoff
