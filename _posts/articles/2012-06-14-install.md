Poole itself is just a static webpage, and doesn't require any server-side bits. Instead it interacts directly with the Github API for managing your repo's contents. 

The Github API is somewhat funky from time to time, and hard to debug. We had to be aware of CORS issues and properly setting up headers for authorization. What's challenging here, is that Github just offers a low level API (around trees and blobs), which is problematic in many cases, as it requires a lot of subsequent requests to do simple things, which slows down site performance. That's why creating a good architecture was crucial to manage the complexity. I ended up in abstracting the data layer into a separate module, Github.js.


Github.js
-----------------

[Github.js](https://github.com/poole/github) is a higher-level wrapper around the Github API. It's intended for exactly our use case, namely interacting with Github from the browser. It supports reading, writing, renaming and deleting files. Goal was to have a simple data abstraction layer, nothing to fancy, but providing exactly the operations we need.
